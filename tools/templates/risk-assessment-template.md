# Risk Assessment Template
## Overview
This document provides a standardized approach for conducting risk assessments as part of security audits.

## Risk Scoring Matrix
### Impact Levels
- **Critical (5)**: Severe business impact, significant financial loss, major reputational damage
- **High (4)**: Major business impact, substantial financial loss, moderate reputational damage
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate business impact, notable financial loss
- **Low (2)**: Minor business impact, minimal financial loss
- **Very Low (1)**: Negligible business impact

### Likelihood Levels
- **Very Likely (5)**: Expected to occur multiple times per year
- **Likely (4)**: Expected to occur once per year
- **Possible (3)**: Expected to occur once every 2 years
- **Unlikely (2)**: Expected to occur once every 5 years
- **Rare (1)**: Expected to occur less than once every 5 years

## Risk Assessment Process
1. **Asset Identification**
   - List critical assets
   - Determine asset value
   - Document asset owners
   - Identify dependencies

2. **Threat Assessment**
   - Identify potential threats
   - Evaluate threat sources
   - Document threat capabilities
   - Assess threat motivation

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Identify vulnerabilities
   - Evaluate existing controls
   - Determine vulnerability severity
   - Document mitigation options

4. **Risk Analysis**
   - Calculate risk scores
   - Prioritize risks
   - Document risk levels
   - Recommend controls

## Documentation Requirements
